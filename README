To Set Up Dev Env:
The recommended way is to use hub script under the root directory. For instance, to initialize the environment, please use "./hub init"

Or, you can also set up dev env manually as follows:
1. install nvm to manage node.js versions
   https://github.com/creationix/nvm
2. install node.js v0.4.11 & npm for development
   nvm install v0.4.11
